      The UCLA Digital Library Program (DLP) serves as the catalyst for the
      creation, management, and delivery of digital content in support of the
      UCLA Library mission and goals. The Program provides for the storage and
      dissemination of digital objects, including text, images, audio, and video
      in their various digital manifestations and combinations. The UCLA Library
      provides a web presence for digital collections, and provides storage,
      backup and digital preservation support for all digital content accepted
      into, or developed by, the Library.
